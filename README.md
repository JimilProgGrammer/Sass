# Sass
An Angular + Spring Boot + MongoDB project that graphs the price of stocks over a period of time, and predicts the resistance and support of the stock for the next month using simple trend analysis.

# Abstract
A stock market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks, which represent ownership claims on businesses. These may include securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately. A stock represents a claim on the company's assets and earnings. With a multitude of companies getting their stocks listed on a public stock exchange, it gets difficult to keep up with a particular preferred stock and to miss out on important upcoming ones that are sure to be on an upward trend. SASS provides a user-friendly view for stock prices and important technical indicators. It also assists buyers and sellers in taking more informed decisions, by providing recommendations through emails.
